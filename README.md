MAD is a discrete event simulator to study the dynamics of microservices architectures where each service encompasses 
several interacting feedback loops.

More to come soon.

## TODO

* Retry policy on the server (or client?) side, when request are rejected
* Measure the arrival rate on the server side
* Measure rejection rate on the client-side of the server
* Make a fake server, on which one can control both its response time and its rejection rate
* Sensitivity Analysis
